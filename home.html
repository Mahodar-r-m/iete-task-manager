                    The biggest airplane ever built now has two flights under its belt.Stratolaunch’s Roc carrier plane, which is being groomed to haul hypersonic vehicles aloft, conducted its second-ever test flight Thursday morning (April 29)          Roc reached a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet (4,267 m) and a top speed of 199 mph (320 km/h) during Thursday’s test flight, which Stratolaunch deemed a success.

                    “We’re very pleased with how the Stratolaunch aircraft performed today, and we are equally excited about how much closer the aircraft is to launching its first hypersonic vehicle,” Stratolaunch chief operating officer Zachary Krevor said during a postflight news conference. The plane will now serve as a mobile launch platform for hypersonic vehicles, maneuverable craft that travel at least five times faster than the speed of sound. Stratolaunch is developing its own family of hypersonic vehicles, including a reusable 28-foot-long (8.5 m) craft called Talon-A, which will be the first to fly with Roc.
                     “One of the areas that we’re looking at is, how can we help the Department of Defense in mitigating risks for a lot of their expensive flight testing?” Millman said.
